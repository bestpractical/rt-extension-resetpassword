DESCRIPTION
    This extension for RT adds a new "Forgot your password?" link to the
    front of your RT instance. Any user can request that RT send them a
    password reset token by email. RT will send the user a one-time URL
    which he or she can use to reset her password. This extension allows
    only users that already have passwords reset their passwords by email.
    There isn't yet an option to only allow privileged or unpriviliged users
    to reset their passwords.

INSTALL
    This extension should be compatible with RT 3.4 and later

    To install this extension:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make install
        make initdb # first time only, not on upgrades

    If you are running RT 3.8 or later, you must add RT-Extension-
    ResetPassword to your @Plugins in your RT_SiteConfig

    Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::ResetPassword Your::Other::Extensions));

    Make sure you clear your mason cache before restarting apache rm -rf
    /opt/rt3/var/mason_data/obj/* apachectl restart
