DESCRIPTION
    This extension for RT adds a new "Forgot your password?" link to the
    front of your RT instance. Any user can request that RT send them a
    password reset token by email. RT will send the user a one-time URL
    which he or she can use to reset her password. This extension allows
    _all_ users to reset their passwords by email. There isn't yet an option
    to only allow staff users or non-staff users to reset their passwords.

INSTALL
    This extension should be compatible with RT 3.4 and later

    To install this extension:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make install

    If you are running RT 3.8 or later, you must add RT-Extension-
    ResetPassword to your @Plugins in your RT_SiteConfig

    Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::ResetPassword Your::Other::Extensions));

    Make sure you clear your mason cache before restarting apache rm -rf
    /opt/rt3/var/mason_data/obj/* apachectl restart
