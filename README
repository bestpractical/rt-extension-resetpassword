NAME
    RT::Extension::ResetPassword - add "forgot your password?" link to RT
    instance

DESCRIPTION
    This extension for RT adds a new "Forgot your password?" link to the
    front of your RT instance. Any user can request that RT send them a
    password reset token by email. RT will send the user a one-time URL
    which he or she can use to reset her password. This extension allows
    only users that already have passwords reset their passwords by email.
    There isn't yet an option to only allow privileged or unpriviliged users
    to reset their passwords.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.0, 4.2, 4.4

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    make initdb
        Only run this the first time you install this module.

        If you run this twice, you may end up with duplicate data in your
        database.

        If you are upgrading this module, check for upgrading instructions
        in case changes need to be made to your database.

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::ResetPassword');

        For RT 4.0, add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::ResetPassword));

        or add RT::Extension::ResetPassword to your existing @Plugins line.

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

UPGRADING
    If you are upgrading from version 0.05, you will need to run make initdb
    as documented in INSTALLATION to install the Template used by this
    Extension.

    To run on RT 4.0 or 4.2, replace this line in the template:

        { RT::Interface::Web::RequestENV('REMOTE_ADDR') }

    with this:

        { $ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'} }

CONFIGURATION
    The contents of the email sent to users can be found in the global
    PasswordReset template (do not confuse this with the core PasswordChange
    template).

    If you want to prevent unauthorised visitors from determining what user
    accounts exist and whether they are disabled, set
    HidePasswordResetErrors to 1 in your RT configuration; then any password
    reset request will appear to the requestor to have resulted in an email
    being sent, thus not revealing the reasons for any failure. All failures
    will still be logged with an appropriate diagnostic message.
