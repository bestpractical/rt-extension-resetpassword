=head1 NAME

RT::Extension::ResetPassword - add "forgot your password?" link to RT instance

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This extension for RT adds a new "Forgot your password?" link to the front
of your RT instance. Any user can request that RT send them a password
reset token by email.  RT will send the user a one-time URL which he or
she can use to reset her password.

It also adds a new option to the user admin page in RT for the RT admin
to send a password reset email for new users or users who have forgotten
their passwords. See below for options to enable this admin feature only
and disable self-service features.

=head1 RT VERSION

Works with RT 4.0, 4.2, 4.4

=head1 INSTALLATION

=over

=item C<perl Makefile.PL>

=item C<make>

=item C<make install>

=item C<make initdb>

Only run this the first time you install this module.

If you run this twice, you may end up with duplicate data
in your database.

If you are upgrading this module, check for upgrading instructions

=back

=head1 UPGRADING

If you are upgrading from version 0.05, you will need to run C<make
initdb> as documented in L<INSTALLATION> to install the Template used by
this Extension.

To run on RT 4.0 or 4.2, replace this line in the template:

    { RT::Interface::Web::RequestENV('REMOTE_ADDR') }

with this:

    { $ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'} }

=head1 CONFIGURATION

This extension resets passwords managed by RT. It cannot reset
passwords for RTs that use any configured external auth such as
SAML, OAuth, LDAP, or Active Directory as RT does not have
password reset connections in those external systems.

The contents of the email sent to users can be found in the global
PasswordReset template (do not confuse this with the core PasswordChange
template).

If you want to prevent unauthorized visitors from determining what user
accounts exist and whether they are disabled, set HidePasswordResetErrors
to 1 in your RT configuration; then any password reset request will
appear to the requestor to have resulted in an email being sent, thus
not revealing the reasons for any failure. All failures will still be
logged with an appropriate diagnostic message.

For an RT open to the internet the most secure configuration is to use the default
configuration ( This means setting no config options from below ). The default
configuration only allows for existing users with an existing password to reset
their password.

If the rights schema for the RT is tight then it could be desirable to allow users
who have a user record in RT ( They have emailed RT before ) but no password to create
a password for themselves by setting $AllowUsersWithoutPassword to 1. This can allow for
any user to access the RT self service pages. This can be dangerous if the RT rights are
not set-up correctly as users could see data they should not be able to.

The $CreateNewUserAndSetPassword and $CreateNewUserAsPrivileged config
options should only be used when access to the RT web UI is limited.
This usually means access to the web UI is restricted so that only users
on the company network can access the UI and create new user records.

=over 4

=item C<$AllowUsersWithoutPassword>

Setting this config option to true will allow existing users who do
not have a password value to send themselves a reset password email
and set a password.

=item C<$CreateNewUserAsPrivileged>

Set this config value to true if users creating a new account should
default to privileged users.

B<WARNING> Setting this to true can be dangerous as it allows anyone to
create a new priviledged user. Usually privlidged users are given rights
to edit and see information not desired to be public.

=item C<$CreateNewUserAndSetPassword>

This configuration option determines if a nonexistant user can create an
new user record.

B<WARNING> See the note about the danger of setting this to true and
setting C<$CreateNewUserAsPrivileged> to true as well.

=item C<$DisableResetPasswordOnLogin>

Set this config value to true if you do not want the "forgot password" option
to display on the login page.

This is useful if you want only the password reset email option on the RT
user admin page, but no self-service options.
